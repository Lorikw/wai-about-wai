Thank you for your interest in translating resources from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

You are welcome to translate any WAI resource. For suggestions on which to translate first, see [Translation Priorities below].

**Scope:**
* The instructions cover web pages with a URI that begins with www.w3.org/WAI
* For web pages that begin with www.w3.org/TR/ there is a different process that is being updated in early 2019. Some information is in [TR Translations below](@@).

## Translation Steps

**If you want to translate a WAI resource:**
1. Read [Translations Guidance below](@@).
2. Check that there is not already a translation completed or in-progress. {@@link to list – hopefully W3C list; otherwise, maybe All WAI Translations & WCAG 2 Translations}
3. Indicate your interest in translating the resource by {@@GitHub issue for W3C system – or sending an e-mail to the [w3c-translators@w3.org mailing list](mailto:w3c-translators@w3.org) &/or wai-translations ?}
   * WAI staff will send you an e-mail letting you know that the resource is ready to be translated.

**To translate a WAI resource:**
After you have completed the steps above and after you have received notification that the resources is ready to be translated, follow the steps below either in GitHub or via e-mail.

**_'If you can use GitHub: {#git}_**'
4. Go to the English version of the resource. Near the bottom, in the "Help improve this page" box, select the "Fork & Edit on GitHub" button.
5. Make changes. In the Commit changes area:
   * Select the option button for "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." 
   * Change the branch name (from ''you-patch-1'') to ''[language code]-translation'' using the language codes from I[ANA language code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) <br>for example: zh-translation
6. You can preview your translation from @@
7. When you are done with your translation, create a new pull request. Under "Assignees", put ''slhenry''. If you have suggestions for Reviews who use GitHub, you can select them under Reviewers. If they are not in GitHub, you can list their name and contact info in the comment area.
   * We will contact you if something is needed. Otherwise, you will get notification from GitHub when the translation is published.

**_'If you are not comfortable with GitHub, use e-mail: {nogit}_**'
4. Go to the English version of the resource.
   * Near the bottom, in the "Help improve this page" box, select the "Fork & Edit on GitHub" button.
   * Select all the text from the "Edit file" area. (You can probably: click anywhere in the text area, select all (in Windows: Ctrl+A; Mac: a+A), copy (in Windows: Ctrl+C; Mac: a+C).
   * Paste it into a text file.
5 When you are done with your translation, e-mail it to wai-translations@w3.org with subject: Completed Translation – [language code] – [document name]
   * We will contact you if something is needed. Otherwise, we will send you e-mail when the translation is published.

## Important Translations Guidance

* Please leave the code, HTML, and markdown as is without changing it (other than at the top as noted after #).
* Make sure to translate image alts.
* Check if there is any translation guidance for the specific resource.
   1. Go to the English version of the resource. Near the bottom, in the "Help improve this page" box, select the "New GitHub Issue" button.
   2. Near the top, click the path after "w3c/", which usually starts with "wai-".
   3. Scroll down to the README.md section. Any guidance will be under a heading "Translation Notes".
* Check if there is any translation guidance for the specific language. (@@link)
* Make sure to translate image alts.
* **Do not change or adapt or add to the meaning of the English version in your translation**. If you have suggestions for changes to the English version, submit them via GitHub or e-mail with the links in the "Help improve this page" box near the bottom of the page.

By submitting a translation, you agree:
* To the redistribution terms of the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/doc-license). Your translation may be republished by the W3C or other entities if it is done in compliance with the License terms.
* That the W3C may rescind your right to publish or distribute the derivative work if the W3C finds that it leads to confusion regarding the original document's status or integrity. ([Source](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#translate).)

### Updating Resources

If the English version of a resource is updated, we will inform translators what has changed, and request that translators update their translation.

If the changes are only small changes, such as a new paragraph or a new short section, we might add the English to the translation while awaiting an update. If the changes are substantive, the translation will be removed until an updated version is provided.

### Additional Information

General information about [Translations at W3C]( http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/) is being updated in 2019.

More information is available in W3C’s <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620">intellectual rights FAQ</a>, particularly under the questions starting with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#translate">can I translate one of your specifications into another language?</a> There is also useful information in the section on <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#Documents">W3C Documents</a> in
the FAQ, including the “<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#really">can I change it?</a>” question; the “<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#official">is it official?</a>” question, and the “<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#annotate">can I annotate it?</a>” question.

## Translation Priorities

@@

## TR Translations & Authorized W3C Translations

For web pages at URIs that begin with www.w3.org/TR/ there is a different process that is being updated in early 2019. Previous information is available in [W3C Translations](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/).

Most translations are informative and unofficial. In cases where standards translations are meant for official purposes, they may be developed as Authorized W3C Translations according to the **[Policy for Authorized W3C Translations]( http://www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy.html)**. Generally only completed W3C Recommendations and Working Group Notes are candidates for Authorized W3C Translations, including the WAI guidelines. The authorized translations policy is designed to ensure transparency and community accountability in the development of authorized translations under the oversight of W3C.





## OLD -- Priorities for Translating WAI Documents --- OLD

People frequently ask us which WAI documents they should translate. Four
lists are below:

1.  Top priority WCAG 2.0 materials
2.  High priority introductory and short materials
3.  Secondary priority introductory and short materials
4.  Secondary priority technical materials

These lists are **suggested** priorities only. They are not meant to
prevent people from translating documents for which they have a specific
need. If you are interested in translating WAI documents that are not
listed on this page or on the [W3C Technical
Reports](http://www.w3.org/TR/) page, please inquire first by contacting
us at <wai@w3.org>.

**See the status information for each document.** Some documents are
available now, but will be updated soon. You might choose to provide a
translation now, or wait until the document is updated.
